# A plus B
a classic problem in programming contests,   it's given so contestants can gain familiarity with the online judging system being used

##### Task
Given two integers,   A and B.
Their sum needs to be calculated.

#####  Input data
Two integers are written in the input stream, separated by space(s):

#####  Output data
The required output is one integer:   the sum of A and B.

#####  Example
```
input  	output  
2 2	    4
3 2	    5
```

# Arithmetic/Integer
no description available

##### Task
Get two integers from the user,   and then (for those two integers), display their:

-  sum
-  difference
-  product
-  integer quotient
-  remainder
-  exponentiation   (if the operator exists)

Don't include error handling.

For quotient, indicate how it rounds   (e.g. towards zero, towards negative infinity, etc.).

For remainder, indicate whether its sign matches the sign of the first operand or of the second operand, if they are different.

# Array Concatenation
no description available

##### Task
Show how to concatenate two arrays in your language.

If this is as simple as `array1 + array2`, so be it.

# Array Concatenation
no description available

##### Task
Determine the amount of elements in an array.

As an example use an array holding the strings 'apple' and 'orange'.


[back to top](#table-of-contents)


# Arrays
This task is about arrays.

##### Task
Show basic array syntax in your language.

Basically, create an array, assign a value to it, and retrieve an element   (if available, show both fixed-length arrays and dynamic arrays, pushing a value into it).

# Call a function
no description available

##### Task
Demonstrate the different syntax and semantics provided for calling a function.

This may include:

-  Calling a function that requires no arguments
-  Calling a function with a fixed number of arguments
-  Calling a function with optional arguments
  Calling a function with a variable number of arguments
-  Calling a function with named arguments
-  Using a function in statement context
-  Using a function in first-class context within an expression
-  Obtaining the return value of a function
-  Distinguishing built-in functions and user-defined functions
-  Distinguishing subroutines and functions
-  Stating whether arguments are passed by value or by reference
-  Is partial application possible and how

This task is not about defining functions.

# Character Codes
no description available

##### Task
Given a character value in your language, print its code   (could be ASCII code, Unicode code, or whatever your language uses).

#####  Example
The character   'a'   (lowercase letter A)   has a code of 97 in ASCII   (as well as Unicode, as ASCII forms the beginning of Unicode).

Conversely, given a code, print out the corresponding character.

# Check that File Exists
no description available

##### Task
Verify that a file called `input.txt` and a directory called `docs` exist.

This should be done twice:  

-  once for the current working directory,   and
-  once for a file and a directory in the filesystem root.

Optional criteria (May 2015):   verify it works with:

-  zero-length files
-  an unusual filename:   `Abdu'l-Bahá.txt

# Conditional Structures
no description available

##### Task
List the   conditional structures   offered by a programming language.

Common conditional structures are `if-then-else` and `switch`

# Copy a String
Task is about copying a string

##### Task
Where it is relevant, distinguish between copying the contents of a string versus making an additional reference to an existing string. 

[back to top](#table-of-contents)


# Create a File
In this task, the job is to create a new empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory called "docs". This should be done twice: once "here", i.e. in the current working directory and once in the filesystem root.

# Detect Division by Zero
no description available

##### Task
Write a function to detect a `divide by zero error` without checking if the denominator is zero.

# Determine If Numeric String
no description available

##### Task
Create a boolean function which takes in a string and tells whether it is a numeric string (floating point and negative numbers included) in the syntax the language uses for numeric literals or numbers converted from strings.

# Empty Program
no description available

##### Task
Create the simplest possible program that is still considered "correct." 

[back to top](#table-of-contents)


# Empty String
Languages may have features for dealing specifically with empty strings (those containing no characters).

##### Task
-  Demonstrate how to assign an empty string to a variable.
-  Demonstrate how to check that a string is empty.
-  Demonstrate how to check that a string is not empty.

# Environment Variables
no description available

##### Task
Show how to get one of your process's environment variables.

The available variables vary by system;   some of the common ones available on Unix include:

-  PATH
-  HOME
-  USER

# Factorial
The factorial of   0   (zero)   is defined as being   1   (unity).
 
The   Factorial Function   of a positive integer,   n,   is defined as the product of the sequence:
```
n, n-1, n-2, ... 1
```

##### Task
Write a function to return the factorial of a number.

Solutions can be iterative or recursive.

Support for trapping negative   n   errors is optional.

# File IO
no description available

##### Task
Create a file called   "output.txt",   and place in it the contents of the file   "input.txt",   via an intermediate variable.

In other words, your program will demonstrate:

  1. how to read from a file into a variable
  2. how to write a variable's contents into a file

Oneliners that skip the intermediate variable are of secondary interest — operating systems have copy commands for that.

# Find Recursion Limit

##### Task
Find the limit of recursion.

# FizzBuzz
no description available

##### Task
Write a program that prints the integers from   1   to   100   (inclusive).

But:

1.  for multiples of three,   print   Fizz     (instead of the number)
2.  for multiples of five,   print   Buzz     (instead of the number)
3.  for multiples of both three and five,   print   FizzBuzz     (instead of the number)

The   FizzBuzz   problem was presented as the lowest level of comprehension required to illustrate adequacy.

##### Task
Express a number in decimal as a fixed-length string with leading zeros.

#####  Example
```
Input: 7.125
00007.125
```
